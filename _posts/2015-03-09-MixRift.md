My first [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) built project and hack week project to create a playable alternate interface for exploring MixRadio mixes. This ended up taking the form of a music guessing game. Built with the Unity Engine  the majority of scripts written in Javascript (the Oculus script is in C#). 

I used the the [MixRadio public API](http://dev.mixrad.io/doc/rest/) to gather 30 second clips and metadata from MixRadios mixes. It also includes Oculus Rift support and kinect movement support using [Zigfu](http://zigfu.com/). Though this didnâ€™t make the final version due to flakey connectivity which I ran out of time to make stable ,Oculus support worked out well and is available in the downloadable version.


How many songs can you guess ? Have a play [Here](http://almerc.github.io/MixRift/)

It is also hosted on [MixLabs](http://labs.mixrad.io/hacks/mixrift) along with other MixRadio hack week projects.
