title: MixRift

My first [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) project is complete. MixRift was a hack week project to create a guessing game based around  exploring MixRadio mixes.

Built with the Unity Engine the scripts I've written in Javascript. 
I used the the [MixRadio public API](http://dev.mixrad.io/doc/rest/) to gather 30 second clips and metadata from MixRadios pre-made mixes. It also includes Oculus Rift support and kinect movement support using [Zigfu](http://zigfu.com/). Though this didnâ€™t make the final version due to flakey connectivity which I ran out of time to make stable .Oculus support worked out well and is available in the downloadable version.

It is also hosted along with other MixRadio hack week project on [MixLabs](http://labs.mixrad.io/hacks/mixrift)
