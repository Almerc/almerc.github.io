MixRadios hack week was again a total blast, I built my first project in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) called MixRift: An interactive guessing game based around exploring MixRadio mixes with the Oculus Rift.

Built with the Unity Engine the scripting written in Javascript. I used the the [MixRadio public API](http://dev.mixrad.io/doc/rest/) to gather 30 second clips and metadata from MixRadios pre-made mixes. It also includes Oculus Rift support via the [Oculus Unity Plugin](https://developer.oculusvr.com/)  and kinect movement using [Zigfu](http://zigfu.com/). Though this didnâ€™t make the final version due to flakey connectivity which I ran out of time to make stable .Oculus support worked out well and is available in the downloadable version.

It is also hosted along with other MixRadio hack week project on [MixLabs](http://labs.mixrad.io/hacks/mixrift)
