title: DIY Mini Greenhouse
---

Giving an old TV stand a second life by turning it into a mini greenhouse. Ideas to be more self-sufficient with only a little inner city garden space available. The perfect project for a long Easter weekend.

### Materials

* 1 Old unloved wooden tv stand. Free..
* 4 sheets of clear plastic. 600mm x 1200mm x 2mm. £17 per sheet.
* 3m of wooden rods. £2
* Pack of screws. £1.50
* Handle. £2
* Outdoor hinges £2
* Wine bottle corks.
* Outdoor wood treatment oils.
* Poly-Adhesive £8.

### Tools

* Workbench
* Drill
* Sandpaper
* Jigsaw
* Screwdriver

#### Gutting the shelves

The screws were rusted and stuck into the wooden frame. As I wanted to reuse the sides to strengthen the greenhouse frame, I needed to keep the wood intact. I instead removed the shelves from the inside using a hand saw.

#### Cutting the plastic sheets

This material is quite brittle and takes a bit of care when cutting. I used a jigsaw with a fine blade, applied a bit of pressure and made sure the jigsaw was moving consistently when cutting. Even with this it still chipped and cracked a few times along the edges but these are hidden behind the panels or glued using poly-adhesive.

#### Attaching the panels

Again this requires more fun with plastic sheets , this time using a drill . It is well worth getting an old scrap of wood to place underneath the sheet whilst drilling through it. Again applying a bit of pressure , holding your breath and hoping for the best. Once the holes are drilled the sheet was screwed to the frame. I cut some other pieces of wood from some old ikea shelving to create a more flush and level bottom shelf. I attached the side panels directly to the front and back using adhesive. This seems to hold ok but if I find this fails from strong winds, I'll strengthen by attaching to the bottom of the frame as well.

#### The lid

I used another plastic sheet of the same thickness, 2mm, but cut slightly wider and longer for the lid. I would recommend to get this thicker for a heavier lid if possible. Instead, I built a frame around the edge sheet to add the weight and create a lip around the top of the unit. I also added a handle and hinges to the beam at the back and used small cuts of spare wood to support on the plastic sheet.

#### Finishing touches

To make sure the unit is ready for the rain, and storm Katie forecast on the weekend, I treated all the pieces of wood with a few layers of an outdoor oil based treatement. I may also paint the top of the frame at a later date. To protect from the protruding screws whilst tending to plants, I sliced some wine bottle corks and placed them over the sharp ends. 

Now to play the waiting game for these delicious vegetables..
