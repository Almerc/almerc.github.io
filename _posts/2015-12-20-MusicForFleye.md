title: Music for Fleye
---

Flying Robots are here! I a piece for [Fleye](http://gofleye.com/)  .Watch  their [kickstarter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShNS-WLGVLo) to hear it.

####The Brief

* Our video should last ~3 minutes.

* we plan to have 20~30 secs intro with Fleye discovering the world, as
an
autonomous robot. Will be an urban exploration style.

* The sound will be evolving between foreground music supporting the
unspoken sequences, and simpler background loops low volumes during
the
spoken text.

* In terms of musical style, we want to convene a sense of innovation
(futuristic, robotic, etc), and a sense of friendliness (safety,
human,
etc), while keeping it fast paced (but not too much).

* I would say a ~120 bpm house beat with funky piano/bass/synth lines. Old
Daft Punk (discovery, homework) seems like an interesting inspiration.

####Idea

I went for a 125 bpm tempo with a steady but funky electronica house
style in D major. I had ideas for 4 separate sections, beginning with something quite sparse
but
with anticipation and build up to introduce the fleye where I imagine there will be speech and shots of the
fleye setup/prepare for launch which moves into a full bass groove,
bigger chord layers and movement in the piece while the Fleye is in
motion.

I wanted the piece to progressively evolve elements or introduce new parts as Fleye is discovering and learning from the world. 
These are the shots of fleye taking off from a field where the arrangement becomes a more spacious ambient breakdown section introducing piano chords and a full and much fatter breakbeat section for flying inside the urban warehouse.

The very final section being a culmination of all the elements.
