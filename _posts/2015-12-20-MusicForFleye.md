title: Music for Fleye
---

Flying Robots are here! I made a piece for [Fleye](http://gofleye.com/) . Watch [kickstarter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShNS-WLGVLo) to hear it and if you are excited for the prospective of a future full of these show your support and back them on [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gofleye/fleye-your-personal-flying-robot).

#### The Brief

![Fleye](http://theawesomer.com/photos/2015/12/fleye_drone_t.jpg "Fleye")

* Our video should last ~3 minutes.

* we plan to have 20~30 secs intro with Fleye discovering the world, as
an
autonomous robot. Will be an urban exploration style.

* The sound will be evolving between foreground music supporting the
unspoken sequences, and simpler background loops low volumes during
the
spoken text.

* In terms of musical style, we want to convene a sense of innovation
(futuristic, robotic, etc), and a sense of friendliness (safety,
human,
etc), while keeping it fast paced (but not too much).

* I would say a ~120 bpm house beat with funky piano/bass/synth lines. Old
Daft Punk (discovery, homework) seems like an interesting inspiration.

#### Idea

Making a 125 bpm tempo with a steady but funky electronica house
style. I had ideas for 4 separate sections, beginning with something quite clean, sleek and functional to go with Fleyes design .
Then with build up to introduce the fleye where I imagine there will be speech and shots of the
fleye setup/prepare for launch. Then moving into a full bass groove,
bigger chord layers and movement in the piece while the Fleye is in
motion.

I didn't want it to be too busy and in your face as to detract from the information during speech or watching the fleye itself. Although making it electronic for sure, I wanted to avoid using anything glitchy or complex layered rythmns so it doesn't come across dizzying or give the impression the drone is bugging out and on a chaotic rampage.

I wanted the piece to progressively evolve elements or introduce new parts as Fleye is discovering and learning from the world. 
These are the shots of fleye taking off from a field where the arrangement becomes a more spacious ambient breakdown section introducing piano chords and a full and much fatter breakbeat section for flying inside the urban warehouse.

The very final section being a culmination of all the elements and bringing it to a close.

I'll add details on the process soon...
