Through the exciting freedom of being asked 'what would you like to create this week?' whilst at work and recently acquiring an Oculus Rift DK. I hacked together a maze game to walk around in whilst listening to MixRadio for MixRadios very first hack week. 

The project was written in Javascript using mrdoobs excellent 3D Javascript library [threeJS](http://threejs.org/) to render WebGL 3D graphics in the browser. I hooked up the [MixRadio public API](http://dev.mixrad.io/doc/rest/) to pull music clips into the game.

Highlights of this hack were using arrays to make a grid to build the level. This makes a useful and reusable visual representation for arranging the level and there were to be more levels built. Oculus Rift integration and reading rift data in real time, not laggy! And most excitingly ,writing JS in 4 days that results in 3D graphics playable in my browser at a decent framerate!

*If you have a rift be sure to install and run Oculus Bridge (from Oculus Bridge folder or [Oculus Bridge](https://github.com/Instrument/oculus-bridge)).
