title: Soldering and Screaming
---

I have been jamming with guitar stompboxes since my teens and became addicted to collecting and building a monster pedal board to experiment with effects, often resulting in a cacophony of psychadelic noise. It was a lot of fun and I spent an obscene amount of money in the process. Recently I came across this website [Fuzzdogs pedal parts](http://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/) and was interested to find out what goes into building effects pedals and improve my soldering skills in the process.
