title: Soldering and Screaming
---

I have been jamming with guitar stompboxes since I started my first band in my teens and became addicted to collecting and building a monster pedal board to combine different combinations of effects resulting in a cacophony of awesome noise or experimental psychadelia. I spent an obscene amount of money in the process. Recently I came across this website [Fuzzdogs pedal parts](http://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/) and was interested to find out what goes into making effects pedals and improve my soldering skills.
