title: Soldering and Screaming
---

Guitar stompboxes were once an addiction of mine. Collecting and building a monster pedal board to experiment and combine effects, often resulting in a cacophony of psychadelic noise, was a lot of fun and I spent an obscene amount of money trying to build my dream setup for jamming. Recently I came across this website for pedal kits [Fuzzdogs pedal parts](http://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/) and was interested to get inside the stompbox and learn a bit how they work , improve my soldering skills and hopefully end up with a useable Tubescreamer to play with.  

The [Tubescreamer](http://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/Tube_Screamer_TS808__TS9/p847124_7462506.aspx) kit I ordered is modeled on Stevie Ray Vaughns signiture sound the TS808 and TS9 which go for around £150 so if I could put one together for £35 (including the case) which got close to that sound it'd be a bargain and I'd be chuffed with myself for building it.  

I'm pretty much a beginner with soldering electronics so spotting how small the the pcb board was (50 x 37mm!) and how many components there were was pretty daunting. Fuzzdogs kit came with very clear downloadable [instructions](http://pedalparts.co.uk/docs/TubeScreamer2.pdf) with an easy to follow circuit diagram and components labeled on the pcb. The only thing you really need to do is determine is which resistor is which. This can be done by using a [colour code chart](http://www.digikey.co.uk/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band) OR if you're eyes are hurting from squinting for a long time trying to make a judgment call on whether the ring is red or brown then you could also use a multi-meter to double check.

I would also highly recommend using a [Helping Hands with a magnifying glass](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NY8YBAA?psc=1) to hold the pcb still whilst you do this work. This saved a lot of frustration when
placing and soldering components and checking over dodgy solder work.
