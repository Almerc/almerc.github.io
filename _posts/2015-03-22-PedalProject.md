title: Soldering and Screaming
---

I have been jamming with guitar stompboxes since my teens and was addicted to collecting and building a monster pedal board to combine and play with different combinations of sounds. I spent an obscene amount of money in the process. Recently I came across this website [Fuzzdogs pedal parts](http://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/) and was interested to find out what goes into making effects pedals and improve my soldering skills.
